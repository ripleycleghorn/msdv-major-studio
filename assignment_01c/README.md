## Project Answers
1. This visualization will be be more informative than explorative. It will allow users to learn the basics about a *quipu*, the ancient Incan counting device, by looking up-close at one specific *quipu* in the Smithsonian collection. This device used chords and their color and texture properties, as well as knots, to collect information and keep records. The visualization will provide a quantitative look at this object; for example, how many knots it has, how many chords, what color, etc.
2. I'm hoping that the takeaway after looking at this  visualization is an appreciation for this system of information gathering and record keeping, which to me, managed to store quite a lot of information in a relatively compact space.

    1. The visualization methods that will be used are varied. The main visual aspect will be the photo of the *quipu*, which I decided is the best representation of this device. Additionally, I will try to add a dendogram style visualization to represent the basic components&mdash;the knots and chords. Although the photo is the most realistic, it's hard to see the details of each chord. Therefore, I'm hoping the dendogram will help convey the *amount* of information stored in the *quipu*. Additionally, there will probably be a bar chart describing the number of chords by color. I will also include a few inforgraphic style diagrams to convey the method of counting used in *quipu*.
3. I'm targeting people who have never heard of or seen a *quipu* before, as this will serve as an introduction to one.
4. The end product will be used digitally, and will be static. In the future, it would be interesting to make it interactive such that a person can click on a specific part of the dendogram and the subchords are shown up-close.
5. I'll be publishing it online as a website.
6. The data available is mainly the data published through the Khipu Database Project, a database started by a Harvard researcher. This data will allow me to represent the *quipu* graphically, and also provide the quantitative information such as number of knots. The photo will come from the Smithsonian.
    
    1. The dataset is fairly small, consisting of the columns: "chord number", "subsidiary chord", "knots", "length of chord", "color of chord", and "[numerical] value of chord".
    
    2. There are 188 rows of data, one record for each chord in the *quipu*. The quality of the data is high, but certain aspects will need to be decoded using the notes from the dataset, such as color.
7. Additional materials that I could include might be a video of a talk about *quipu* that the Harvard Researcher, Gary Urton, gave (which took place at the Smithsonian).
8. The constraints are important in this visualization. For example, certain *quipu* have been proven to contain census data, however as far as I know this specific *quipu* has not. For the majority of *quipu* studied, the exact type of information carried is only hypothesized and not confirmed. Therefore, I need to keep the scope of the project relatively narrow and focus more on the method of counting, which is more reliable than the purpose it was used for. In the background section, I will still include some of the current hypothesis so as to give a general sense of their purpose.

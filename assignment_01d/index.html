        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p><i>Quipu</i> (also written <i>Khipu</i>) were an ancient record keeping device created in Central and South
          America by indigenous Andeans, prior to Spanish colonization. They were made up of one main cord with many
          connecting pendant cords that contained knots. Pendant cords also sometimes contained subsidiary cords (denoted
          by an 's') that had their own knots. The number and placement of knots determined the value stored in that cord.
          Color and texture of the cord defined the types of information being counted. <i>Quipu</i> were often carried
          from region to region by a <i>Chasqui</i>, or messenger, in order to spread information or to continue
          collecting data. Though they are mainly associated with the Inca civilization due to their widespread use, they
          were used long before them.</p>

        <h3>What Kinds of Data Did They Collect?</h3>
        <p>Although the method of counting on a <i>quipu</i> has been mostly decoded, it remains one of the few verifiable
          facts. Specifically, what was actually being counted is largely a mystery. Despite that, some <i>quipu</i>
          values have been found to exactly match Spanish census documents from the same regions and times. And one
          discovery has tied the social rankings of the people recorded in the census document to correspond to the way
          each cord was tied to the <i>quipu</i>. Other <i>quipu</i> used by the Incas seem to point to keeping track of
          who had paid "taxes" of food, livestock, and other goods. Still more theories include recording planetary
          movement and seasons, months and days. <br><br>An absence of a knot indicates the number zero; the native South
          and Central Americans are considered to be some of the first known civilizations to represent the concept of
          zero.</p>

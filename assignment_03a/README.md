# The Life of Sally Ride

### Project Description

This project is a visual biography of the life of the first American woman to go to space, Sally Ride. The project focuses on her first mission in detail, and incorporates other parts of her life in a condensed manner. In addition to text, images of objects belonging to Sally Ride (curtesy of the Smithsonian open access API) as well as pictures of the mission (courtesy to NASA) help to enrich the storytelling. The biography centers around a timeline that is interactive and allows users to keep track of which part of her life they are reading about (as well as allows users to click on specific years of interest).

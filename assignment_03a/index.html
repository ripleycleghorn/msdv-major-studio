Instead, she opted to study physics and finished her bachelor’s degree at Stanford University. She stayed there, continuing on with her Master’s degree and eventually her PhD.</div>

Although she was training to be a scientist astronaut and not a pilot, she was required to spend 15 hours a month on board a T-38 jet practicing navigation and communication procedures while preparing herself for high performance flight. Part of the job entailed manually calculating factors such as fuel burn, ground speed, and estimated time arrival. Here, the aviation slide rule came in handy. She enjoyed flying the T-38 so much so that she took lessons and got her pilot license.</div>

Two of the communications satellites are being built for PERUMTEL, Indonesia's state-owned telecommunications company. With its 24 transponders, Palapa B was able to deliver voice, video, telephone and high-speed data services electronically linking Indonesia's many islands and bringing advanced telecommunications to the nation's 130 million inhabitants. Palapa operated at 108 degrees east longitude.</div>

               <div class="SPAS-text body-text">Another important important goal of the mission was to deploy the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01). SPAS-01 was unique in that it was built to operate in the payload bay or be deployed by the RMS as a free-flying satellite. <br><br>
                  The RMS, or Remote Manipulator System, was a robotic arm used on the Space Shuttle to deploy, maneuver, and capture payloads.  One of Ride’s principal responsibilities was to operate the robotics arm to deploy and retrieve the SPAS-01. It was mounted with ten experiments to perform research in forming metal alloys in microgravity and use of remote sensing scanner. Seven Get Away Special canisters in cargo bay held variety of experiments, including ones studying affects of space on social behavior of ant colony in zero gravity. <br><br>
                  The video below shows Ride collecting samples as part of those experiments:

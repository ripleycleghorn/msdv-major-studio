            <div class="text body-text">When Shuttle STS-7 took off on June 8th, 1983, Sally Ride made history as the first American woman to go to space. But before we go any further, let’s rewind.</div>

            <div class="part-one heading">Part 1: Early Life</div>
            <div class="uni body-text">Sally began her undegraduate studies at Swarthmore College, and briefly considered pursuing a career as a professional tennis player (after seeing her play, Billie Jean King encouraged her to go pro). Instead, she opted to study physics and finished her bachelor’s degree at Stanford University. She stayed there, continuing on with her Master’s degree and eventually her PhD.</div>

            <div class="chem background-small">This chemical slide rule was used for determining the mass of atoms and molecules. Before pocket-sized electronic calcu-
            lators became available in the 1970s, slide rules were used as an aid to complex mathematical operations. Ride used this device as a university student.</div>
            <div class="apply background-large">While completing the program, she saw a newspaper advertisement recruiting astronauts for NASA’s next mission. She decided to apply.</div>

            <div class="part-two heading">Part 2: Training</div>
            <div class="interviews body-text">In October of 1977 she went to the NASA Johnson Space Center to undergo medical tests and interviews as part 
              of the selection process. Three months later, she was cho-
              sen with five other women and 29 men to create the first class of astronauts for the space shuttle program.</div>

            <div class="training body-text">Ride began training as a mission specialist in preparation for her first mission, STS-7. Although she was training to be a scientist astronaut and not a pilot, she was required to spend 15 hours a month on board a T-38 jet practicing navigation and communication procedures while preparing herself for high performance flight. Part of the job entailed manually calculating factors such as fuel burn, ground speed, and estimated time arrival. Here, the aviation slide rule came in handy. She enjoyed flying the T-38 so much so that she took lessons and got her pilot license.</div>

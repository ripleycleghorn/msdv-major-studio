                  program. <br><br> Ride began training as a mission specialist in preparation for her first
                  mission, STS-7. Although she was training to be a scientist astronaut and not a pilot, she was required to spend 15 hours a month on board a T-38 jet practicing navigation and communication procedures while preparing herself for high performance flight. Part of the job entailed manually calculating factors such as fuel burn, ground speed, and estimated time arrival. Here, the aviation slide rule came in handy. She enjoyed flying the T-38 so much so that she took lessons and got her pilot license.

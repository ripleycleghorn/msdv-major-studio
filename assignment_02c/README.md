# Design Mockup and First Prototype

## Project Questions
* Why are we doing this?
    * What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?
* What are you hoping to achieve?
    * What will I be looking at(title)?
    * Which visualization method is used and why?
* Who are we targeting?
* How is the end product going to be used?
* How are we publishing?
* What data do we have available?
    * Which qualitative dataset is used?
    * What are the properties of the data set?
    * How many data points
    * What's the quality of the data?
* Which other existing materials should we take into account?
* Which constraints do we have?
* Who else is doing something similar?


## Project Answers - considering mockup option 2
1. This visualization is more oriented towards education rather than exploration. It will be a paragraph describing the life of Sally Ride, the first American woman in space.
    1. The questions it aims to answer are: what missions was she apart of and what were her other accomplishments besides going to space?
2. Because this is a qualitative visualization, I decided to go with text as my method. I had created a prototype first based on images, but then came to the conclusion that it didn't tell the story I was aiming to tell. So I switched to text as the main method. 
3. The dataset I used were the images of objects belonging to Sally Ride as well as their descriptions, which I downloaded using the API. The main use of the visualization is to be able to hover over keywords in the text and see the images associated. 
    1. The dataset is not complete, because not all objects were part of the API, but I decided that was okay since this was just a small representation of the objects. I also supplemented with a few sources from NASA and from the Smithsonian outside of the API. In total I have about 20 objects.
4. Something I haven't included in the prototype but will include in the final visualization is the category of each item. I will assign a category using color. 

Here is the prototype I have so far:
